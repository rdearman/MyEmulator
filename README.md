# My Emulator for fictional 8-bit computer

I have written an emulator and assembly language compiler for a fictional 8-bit computer. This was just a learning exercise for me. I've created various versions as I went along. 
I documented it with videos [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIdbG0u0z9rnHt9RGhIWtp3Ctsep7Izoh) if you want to watch them. 


## Installation

You'll need Python, I used version 3.10.12.
